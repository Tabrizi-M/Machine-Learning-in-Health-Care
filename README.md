# Machine-Learning-in-Health-Care

  Causal inferences are used to draw causal (cause and effect) conclusions from data. They have applications in different fields from economics to health care. In this project, we examined a doubly robust method for estimation of causal parameters called TMLE ( Targeted Maximum Likelihood Estimation). TMLE is using the SuperLearner framework which is a flexible ensemble of machine learning models. We also tested TMLE on different datasets and compared the results with traditional methods.
